# Healthcare Revenue Cycle Optimisation
A real-world project focused on Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM), leveraging Azure Data Factory, Databricks, and Medallion architecture to build scalable, KPI-driven data pipelines for financial insights and timely collections.

This repository contains an end-to-end data engineering project focused on **Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** using **Azure** cloud technologies. The project is designed to simulate real-world data engineering scenarios in the healthcare sector and equip participants with hands-on experience in building data pipelines, managing healthcare datasets, and generating insights using modern data platforms.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to provide a complete walkthrough of how to build, manage, and scale data engineering solutions in a healthcare setting. Participants will work with datasets including **Electronic Medical Records (EMR)** and **insurance claims**, utilizing APIs, flat files, and Azure SQL databases.

The project covers:
- Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)
- Accounts Receivable vs Accounts Payable
- KPI tracking and visualization
- Real-time and batch data processing pipelines
- Audit and monitoring mechanisms

##  Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture**:
- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from APIs, flat files, and SQL sources.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, structured data using a common data model (with Slowly Changing Dimensions).
- **Gold Layer**: Aggregated and enriched data used for analytics and reporting.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Azure Data Factory** – Data ingestion
- **Azure Databricks** – Data processing
- **Azure SQL Database** – Structured data storage
- **Azure Data Lake Storage** – Data lake
- **Power BI** (optional) – Dashboarding and KPI visualization

## 📊 Key Concepts Covered

- Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management
- Importance of Accounts Receivable KPIs
- Payment timelines and financial risk mitigation
- Audit trail implementation
- Scalable pipeline design for dynamic data loads
- Common data models and slowly changing dimensions
- User-centric architecture (Engineers, Analysts, Scientists)

## 👨‍💻 User Personas

- **Data Engineers**: Build and maintain pipelines
- **Data Scientists**: Access clean and structured datasets for modeling
- **Business Analysts**: Visualize key metrics and drive strategic decisions

## 📈 Learning Outcomes

- Gain practical experience in cloud data engineering
- Understand real-world healthcare data challenges
- Master Azure-based tools for ingestion, transformation, and storage
- Build scalable, production-grade data pipelines
